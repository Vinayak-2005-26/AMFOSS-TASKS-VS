# Operation Pixel Merge: Image Stitching Script

Welcome, Fleet Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm! Your mission is to stitch together fragmented images to reveal crucial intelligence from the Galactic Empireâ€™s transmission. This project utilizes OpenCV and Pillow to merge multiple image fragments into a complete picture.

## Overview

The goal of this script is to stitch together a set of fragmented images into a single, coherent image. This process involves image recognition and manipulation to correctly align and merge the pieces.

## Features

- Load multiple fragmented images.
- Use image recognition techniques to detect alignment points.
- Stitch the images together into a single complete image.
- Save the resulting image to a file.

#Hridesh bro and my mentors helped in doing this I felt this as little bit tough.
