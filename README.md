## WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEEDBACK ON THE PRAVESHAN SELECTION PROCESS?
The Praveshan selection process was both fun and exciting for me. Admittedly, I faced significant challenges as the tasks pushed me out of my comfort zone. However, my mentors, Chimnayyy Ajith,and Aniketh bro, played a crucial role as a guiding light throughout this journey. His unwavering support and guidance helped me navigate the difficulties.
