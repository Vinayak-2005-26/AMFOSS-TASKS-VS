# Hello world

Welcome to the multi-language programming task repository! This project involves solving four sub-tasks in various programming languages: Python, Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, Rust, and Haskell.

## Sub-Tasks

### Sub-Task 1: "Hello, World!"
Create a program in each language that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Sub-Task 2: File I/O
Write a program that:
1. Reads a string from a file named `input.txt`.
2. Writes that string to another file named `output.txt`.

### Sub-Task 3: Diamond Pattern
Write a program that:
1. Takes a number `n` from the user.
2. Generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (*) with `n` as the maximum width and prints it to the console.

### Sub-Task 4: Diamond Pattern with File I/O
Write a program that:
1. Reads a number `n` from a file named `input.txt`.
2. Generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (*) with `n` as the maximum width.
3. Writes the pattern to another file named `output.txt`.
